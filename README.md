# üéµ EmotionalRec - Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System

## **üìå Overview**
EmotionalRec is an AI-powered **music recommendation system** that analyzes **facial expressions from user-submitted videos** to recommend **personalized Spotify playlists**.

## **üöÄ How It Works**
1. **Emotion Detection** üß†
   - Users upload videos via the frontend.
   - Videos are stored in **Google Drive**.
   - A **Google Colab notebook** polls for new uploads, processes the video using **DeepFace** (RetinaFace specifically), and sends the dominant emotion to the backend.

2. **Backend Processing** ‚öôÔ∏è
   - The **FastAPI backend** receives the emotion via a `POST /colab_callback` route.
   - Internally calls the `/recommend` route to fetch mood-based song suggestions.
   - Optionally creates a Spotify playlist for authenticated users.

3. **Frontend Integration** üíª
   - Built with **React** + **Tailwind CSS**.
   - Users can **log in with Spotify**, **upload a video**, and receive a **playlist embedded on the page**.

## **üõ† Technologies Used**
- **DeepFace** (emotion classification)
- **OpenCV** (video frame processing)
- **Google Colab + PyDrive2** (remote emotion detection)
- **FastAPI** (backend API)
- **Spotipy** (Spotify API for Python)
- **Google Drive API** (video uploads)
- **Ngrok** (expose FastAPI to Colab)
- **React.js** (frontend UI)
- **Tailwind CSS** (styling)

## **üîß Setup Guide**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/EmotionalRec.git
cd EmotionalRec
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Setup**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Create .env File**
```ini
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:8000/callback
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Google Drive Access**
- Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Create a **service account** and download the `.json` key file
- Save it as `gdrive_service_account.json` in root folder
- Share your target Drive folder with the service account email


### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Backend**
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run start
```

## **üöÄ Colab Notebook Setup**
1. Open `colab_notebook.ipynb`
2. Mount Google Drive
3. Ensure `upload_folder` points to shared Drive folder
4. Set `RECOMMENDER_API_URL` to your **ngrok** endpoint (or hosted backend), ngrok is necessary if running locally (needs a key to be used)
5. Run all cells ‚Äì after emotion is detected, it sends a `POST` to `/colab_callback`

---

## **üéØ API Endpoints**

### ‚úÖ **/upload_video**
Uploads a video file to Google Drive.

### ‚úÖ **/process_latest**
Waits for Colab to detect emotion and send the result.
Returns playlist and recommendations.

### ‚úÖ **/colab_callback**
Internal use by Colab to send emotion + access token (if any).
Calls `/recommend` and stores results temporarily.

### ‚úÖ **/recommend**
Recommends songs and optionally creates a playlist.

### ‚úÖ **/login + /callback**
Spotify login flow using OAuth.

## **üåê CORS Setup**
In `main.py`, frontend has to be given access via:
```python
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["http://localhost:3000"],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```
This makes sure that requests from the React app can be processed by the FastAPI backend - due to 2 different local servers.

---

## **üß™ Example Flow**
1. User logs in with Spotify.
2. Uploads a video through frontend.
3. Video is uploaded to Google Drive.
4. Colab processes the video, detects emotion.
5. Sends emotion + token to backend.
6. Backend sends back a playlist.
7. Playlis (iFrame) is embedded in the frontend.
